I am making for another project that will hopefully be better than this weird project that does nothin

- source.rom in RainSembly
- assembler.py to convert RainSembly into bytecode

- main.py which holds the interpreter for the project
- specs.py to configure the specs of the Caldwelldore 64
- manual.txt for when you need to RTFM.

anguage over my fictional character Rain Caldwell, I'm insulting her by creating this dumb project. Le
